# BruteForceBestTableFit
brute forcing the best table fit for entities in categories

# this app is still in development, if by any chance you came here and is intersted, kindly check back in couple of days from date

edit: more updates are now in with generating all possible variations of fitting the entities in collections, then using some domain specific rules i proved yesterday along with some known priciples (actually just 1, pigeonhole principle), the app now generates all the possibilities and limit them down

todo:

- implement the vertical and horizontal scoring
- adjust the sorting and display only best fits
